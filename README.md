FullStack-Encrypto-Tweet
========================

This is my Encrpto-Tweet project from FullStack Academy's JavaScript Jumpstart class.

It has two functions:
1. Encodes a string into a jumble of characters.
2. Decodes a string from that same jumble of characters.

Text can be entered to this website:

I hosted this page using pancake.io.

All HTML, CSS, and jQuery was created by FullStack Academy.
